/**
    Determines the order in which any two objects should be sorted by returning
    a number that has an analogous relationship to zero as the left value to
    the right.  That is, if the left is "less than" the right, the returned
    value will be "less than" zero, where "less than" may be any other
    transitive relationship.

    <p>Arrays are compared by the first diverging values, or by length.

    <p>Any two values that are incomparable return zero.  As such,
    <code>equals</code> should not be implemented with <code>compare</code>
    since incomparability is indistinguishable from equality.

    <p>Sorts strings lexicographically.  This is not suitable for any
    particular international setting.  Different locales sort their phone books
    in very different ways, particularly regarding diacritics and ligatures.

    <p>If the given object is an instance of a type that implements a method
    named "compare", this function defers to the instance.  The method does not
    need to be an owned property to distinguish it from an object literal since
    object literals are incomparable.  Unlike <code>Object</code> however,
    <code>Array</code> implements <code>compare</code>.

    @param {Any} left
    @param {Any} right
    @returns {Number} a value having the same transitive relationship to zero
    as the left and right values.
