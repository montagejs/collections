# Collections

This package contains JavaScript implementations of common data
structures with idiomatic iterfaces, including extensions for Array and
Object.

-   `List(values, equals, content)`: an ordered collection of values
    with fast insertion and deletion and forward and backward traversal,
    backed by a cyclic doubly linked list with a head node.  Lists
    support most of the Array interface, except that they use and return
    nodes instead of integer indicies in analogous functions.
-   `Set(values, equals, hash, content)`: a collection of unique values.
    The set can be iterated in the order of insertion.  With a good hash
    function for the stored values, insertion and removal are fast
    regardless of the size of the collection  Values may be objects.
    The `equals` and `hash` functions can be overridden to provide
    alternate definitions of "unique".  This collection is intended to
    be replaced by a native implementation that does not rely on `hash`.
    `Set` is backed by `FastSet` and `List`.
-   `Map(map, equals, hash, content)`: a collection of key and value
    items with unique keys.  Keys may be objects.  The collection
    iterates in the order of insertion.  This collection is intended to
    be replaced by a native implementation that does not rely on `hash`.
    `Map` is backed by `Set`.
-   `MultiMap(map, content, equals, hash)`: a collection of keys mapped
    to collections of values.  The default `content` collection is an
    `Array`, but it can be a `List` or any other array-like object.
    `MultiMap` inherits `Map` but overrides the `content` constructor.
-   `SortedSet(values, equals, compare, content)`: a collection of
    unique values stored in stored order, backed by a splay tree.  The
    `equals` and `compare` functions can be overridden to provide
    alternate definitions of "unique".
-   `SortedMap(map, equals, compare, content)`: a collection of key
    value pairs stored in sorted order, backed by a sorted set.
    `SortedMap` is backed by `SortedSet` and the `AbstractMap` mixin.
-   `LruSet(values, maxLength, equals, hash, content)`: a cache with the
    Least-Recently-Used strategy for truncating its content when it’s
    length exceeds `maxLength`.  `LruSet` is backed by a `Set` and takes
    advantage of the already tracked insertion order.  Both getting and
    setting a value constitute usage, but checking whether the set has a
    value and iterating values do not.
-   `LruMap(map, maxLength, equals, hash, content)`: a cache of items
    backed by an `LruSet`.
-   `FastSet(values, equals, hash, content)`: a collection of unique
    values stored like a hash table.  The underlying storage is a plain
    JavaScript object that maps hashes to lists of values that share the
    same hash.  Values may be objects.  The `equals` and `hash`
    functions can be overridden to provide alternate definitions of
    "unique".  This collection is intended to be replaced by a native
    implementation that does not rely on `hash`.
-   `FastMap(map, equals, hash, content)`: a collection of key and value
    items with unique keys, backed by a set.  Keys may be objects.  This
    collection is intended to be replaced by a native implementation
    that does not rely on `hash`.  `FastMap` is backed by `FastSet` and
    the `AbstractMap` mixin.
-   `WeakMap()`: a non-iterable collection of key value pairs.  Keys
    must objects and do not benefit from `hash` functions.  Some engines
    already implement `WeakMap`.  The non-iterable requirement makes it
    possible for weak maps to collect garbage when the key is no longer
    available, without betraying when the key is collected.  The shimmed
    implementation undetectably annotates the given key and thus does
    not necessarily leak memory, but cannot collect certain reference
    graphs.  This WeakMap shim was implemented by Mark Miller of Google.
-   `Iterator(iterable)`: a wrapper for any iterable that implements
    `iterate` or iterator the implements `next`, providing a rich lazy
    traversal interface.
-   `Array()`: an ordered collection of values with fast random access,
    push, and pop, but slow splice. The `array` module provides
    extensions so it hosts all the expressiveness of other collections.
    The `array-shim` module shims EcmaScript 5 methods onto the array
    prototype if they are not natively implemented.
-   `Object()`: can be used as a mapping of owned string keys to
    arbitrary values.  The `object` module provides extensions for the
    `Object` constructor that support the map collection interface and
    can delegate to methods of collections, allowing them to gracefully
    handle both object literals and collections.

For all of these constructors, the argument `values` is an optional
collection of initial values, and may be an array.  If the `values` are
in a map collection, the the values are taken, but the keys are ignored.

The `map` argument is an optional collection to copy shallowly into the
new mapping.  The `map` may be an object literal.  If `map` implements
`forEach`, the values for each key are copied.  So, `map` may be an
array, where each index is accepted as the key.

`equals(x, y)`, `compare(x, y)`, and `hash(value)` are all optional
arguments overriding the meaning of equality, comparability, and
consistent hashing for the purposes of the collection.  `equals` must
return a boolean.  `compare` must return an integer with the same
relationship to zero as x to y.  `hash` should consistently return the same
string for any given object.

The default `equals` operator is implemented in terms of `===`, but
treats `NaN` as equal to itself and `-0` as distinct from `+0`.  It also
delegates to an `equals` method of either the left or right argument if
one exists.  The default can be overridden by shimming `Object.equals`.

The default `compare` operator is implemented in terms of `<` and `>`.
It delegates to the `compare` method of either the left or right
argument if one exists.  It inverts the result if it uses the falls to
the right argument.  The default can be overridden by shimming
`Object.compare`.

The default `hash` operator is implemented in terms of `toString`, but
defers to the value's own `hash` member function if it provides one.  If
the hash changes, corresponding values will not be retrievable within
sets or maps that use it.  The default `hash` operator can be overridden
by shimming `Object.hash`.

Consistent hashing is tricky in JavaScript since the language
deliberately avoids providing unique values for each object.  However,
in conjunction with `WeakMap`, it is relatively easy to add a [Unique
Label][] to objects.

[Unique Label]: (http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps#unique_labeler)

The `hash` module provides such an implementation.  Since it entrains
all the weight of the the `weap-map` module, you must opt in by
requiring the module.  If loaded, all new `Map` instances benefit from
fewer hash collisions without the need for per-key-type implementations
of `hash`.

The default `content` function returns `undefined`.  The content
function is used when you `get` a nonexistant value from any collection.
The `content` function becomes a member of the collection object.
`content` is called with the collection as `this`, so you can also use
it to guarantee that default values in a collection are retained, as in
`MultiMap`.


## Collection Methods

Where these methods coincide with the specification of an existing
method of Array, Array is noted as an implementation.  `Array+` refers
to shimmed arrays, as installed with the `array` module.  `Object`
refers to methods implemented on the `Object` constructor function, as
opposed to the `Object.prototype`.  `Object+` in turn refers to methods
shimmed on the object constructor by the `object` module.  These
functions accept the object as the first argument instead of the `this`
implied argument.

-   `has(key)`: (Map, SortedMap, WeakMap) whether a value for the given
    key exists.
-   `has(value, opt_equals)`: (List, Set, SortedSet, Array+, Object+)
    whether a value exists.  collection.  This is slow for list
    (linear), but fast (logarithmic) for Set and SortedSet.
-   `get(key)`: (Map, SortedMap, WeakMap, Array+, Object+) the value for
    a key.  If a Map or SortedMap lacks a key, returns
    `content(key)`.
-   `get(value)`: (List, Set, SortedSet) gets the equivalent value, or
    falls back to `content(value)`.
-   `set(key, value)`: (Map, SortedMap, WeakMap, Array+, Object+) sets
    the value for a key.
-   `add(value)`: (List, Set, SortedSet) adds a value.  Sets silently
    drop the value if an equivalent value already exists.
-   `add(value, key)`: (Map, SortedMap, Array+) sets the value for a
    key, convenient in conjunction with `forEach` due to the callback
    argument order.
-   `addEach(values)`: (List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
    adds all values or key value pairs to this collection.  Works for
    arrays and objects as well as any other collection.
-   `delete(key)`: (Map, SortedMap, WeakMap, Array+) deletes the value
    for a given key.  Returns whether the key was found.
-   `delete(value)`: (List, Set, SortedSet) deletes a value.  Returns
    whether the value was found.
-   `find(value, opt_equals)`: (List, SortedSet, Array+) finds a value.
    For List and SortedSet, returns the node at which the value was
    found.  For SortedSet, the optional `equals` argument is ignored.
-   `findLast(value, opt_equals)`: (List, Array+) finds the last
    equivalent value, returning the node at which the value was found.
-   `findLeast()`: (SortedSet) finds the smallest value, returning the
    node at which it was found, or undefined.  This is fast
    (logarithmic) and performs no rotations.
-   `findLeastGreaterThan(value)`: (SortedSet) finds the smallest value
    greater than the given value.  This is fast (logarithic) but does
    cause rotations.
-   `findLeastGreaterThanOrEqual(value)`: (SortedSet) finds the smallest
    value greater than or equal to the given value.  This is fast
    (logarithmic) but does cause rotations.
-   `findGreatest()`: (SortedSet)
-   `findGreatestLessThan(value)`: (SortedSet)
-   `findGreatestLessThanOrEqual(value)`: (SortedSet)
-   `push(...values)`: (Array, List)
-   `pop()`: (Array, List)
-   `shift()`: (Array, List)
-   `unshift(...values)`: (Array, List)
-   `slice(start, end)`: (Array, List) returns an array of the values
    contained in the half-open interval [start, end), that is, including
    the start and excluding the end.  For lists and arrays, both terms
    may be numeric positive or negative indicies.  For a list, either
    term may be a node.
-   `splice(start, length, ...values)`: (Array, List) Works as with an
    array, but for a list, the start may be an index or a node.
-   `swap(start, length, values)`: (List, Array+) performs a splice
    without variadic arguments.
-   `wipe()`: (List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+, Object+)
    Deletes the all values.
-   `sort(opt_compare)`: (Array) sorts a collection in place.  The
    comparator by only be a function.  The default comparator coerces
    unlike types rather than fail to compare.
-   `sorted(opt_compare, opt_by, opt_order)`: (List, Set, Map,
    SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+) returns a sorted version of the
    collection as an array.  Of map-like objects, only the values are
    produced.  Accepts an optional comparator, relation, and order.  The
    comparator may be a function that compares two arguments returning a
    number relative to zero indicating the direction of the comparison,
    where zero means either equal or incomparable.  The comparator may
    alternately be an object with `{compare, by}` properties.  The
    default comparator is `Object.compare` if shimmed by the `object`
    module, or the simple `compare` function provided by the `operators`
    module which delegates polymorphically to `compare` methods of
    either operand, or falls back to `>` and `<` but only for like
    types.  The `by` relation returns a mapped value for a value in the
    collection on by which to compare values.  `sorted` uses the `by` to
    compute the mapping exactly once, instead of once or twice as can
    happen in the course of sorting.  The optional order property can be
    specified as `-1` for descending order, defaults to `1` for
    ascending, and `0` results in a stable sort, changing nothing.
-   `reverse()`: (Array, List) reverses a collection in place.
-   `reversed()`: (Array, List) returns a collection of the same type
    with this collection's contents in reverse order.
-   `concat(...iterables)`: (Array, Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet,
    SortedMap) Produces a new collection of the same type containing all
    the values of itself and the values of any number of other
    collections.  Favors the last of duplicate values.  For map-like
    objects, the given iterables are treated as map-like objects and
    each successively updates the result.  Array is like a map from
    index to value.  List, Set, and SortedSet are like maps from nodes
    to values.
-   `keys()`: (Map, SortedMap, Object) returns an array of the keys
-   `values()`: (Map, SortedMap, Object+) returns an array of the values
-   `items()`: (Map, SortedMap, Object) returns an array of `[key, value]`
    pairs for each item
-   `reduce(callback(result, value, key, object, depth), basis, thisp)`:
    (Array, Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap)
-   `reduceRight(callback(result, value, key, object, depth), basis,
    thisp)`: (Array, List, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap)
-   `forEach(callback(value, key, object, depth), thisp)`: (Array,
    Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Object+) calls the
    callback for each value in the collection.  The iteration of lists
    is resilient to changes to the list.  Particularly, nodes added
    after the current node will be visited and nodes added before the
    current node will be ignored, and no node will be visited twice.
-   `map(callback(value, key, object, depth), thisp)`: (Array, Iterator,
    List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Object+)
-   `toArray()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap,
    Array+)
-   `toObject()`: (Iterator, Map, SortedMap, Array+) converts any
    collection to an object, treating this collection as a map-like
    object.  Array is like a map from index to value.
-   `filter(callback(value, key, object, depth), thisp)`: (Array, List,
    Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap)
-   `every(callback(value, key, object, depth), thisp)`: (Array,
    Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap) whether every value
    passes a given guard.  Stops evaluating the guard after the first
    failure.  Iterators stop consuming after the the first failure.
-   `some(callback(value, key, object, depth), thisp)`: (Array, List,
    Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap) whether there is a value that passes
    a given guard.  Stops evaluating the guard after the first success.
    Iterators stop consuming after the first success.
-   `any()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
    whether any value is truthy
-   `all()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
    whether all values are truthy
-   `min()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
    the smallest value.  This is fast for sorted collections
    (logarithic), but slow for everything else (linear).
-   `max()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
    the largest value.  This is fast for sorted collections
    (logarithic), but slow for everything else (linear).
-   `one()`: (List, SortedSet, Array+) any single value, or throws an
    exception if there are no values.  This is very fast (constant) for
    all collections.  For a sorted set, the value is not deterministic.
-   `only()`: (List, SortedSet, Array+) the one and only value, or
    throws an exception if there are no values or more than one value.
-   `count()`: (List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
-   `sum()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
-   `average()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap,
    Array+)
-   `flatten()`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap,
    Array+)
-   `zip(...collections)`: (List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap,
    Array+)
-   `enuemrate(zero)`: (Iterator, TODO List, Set, Map, SortedSet,
    SortedMap, Array+)
-   `sorted(compare)`: (List, Set, Map, Array+)
-   `clone(depth, memo)`: (List, Set, Map, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+,
    Object+)
    replicates the collection.  If `Object.clone` is shimmed, clones the
    values deeply, to the specified depth, using the given memo to
    resolve reference cycles (which must the `has` and `set` parts of
    the Map interface, allowing objects for keys)
-   `constructClone(values)`: (Iterator, List, Set, Map, SortedSet,
    SortedMap, Array+) replicates a collection shallowly.  This is used
    by each `clone` implementation to create a new collection of the
    same type, with the same options (`equals`, `compare`, `hash`
    options), but it leaves the job of deeply cloning the values to the
    more general `clone` method.
-   `equals(that)`: (List, Set, Array+, TODO SortedSet, Map, SortedMap)
-   `compare(that)`: (Object+, TODO)
-   `iterate()`: (List, Set, SortedSet, SortedMap, Array+)
    Produces an iterator with a `next` method.  You may elect to get
    richer iterators by wrapping this iterator with an `Iterator` from
    the `iterator` module.  Iteration order of lists is resilient to
    changes to the list.
-   `iterate(start, end)`: (Array+) returns an iterator for all values
    at indicies in the half-open interval [start, end), that is, greater
    than start, and less than end.
-   `iterate(start, end)`: (SortedSet) returns an iterator for all
    values in the half-open interval [start, end), that is, greater than
    start, and less than end.  The iterator is resilient against changes
    to the data.
-   `log(charmap, stringify)`: (Set, Map, SortedSet) writes a tree
    describing the internal state of the data structure to the console.
-   `splay(value)`: (SortedSet) rotates the internal splay tree such
    that the root node is less than or equal to the given value.


### Iterator

-   `dropWhile(callback(value, index, iterator), thisp)`
-   `takeWhile(callback(value, index, iterator), thisp)`
-   `mapIterator(callback(value, index, iterator))`: (Iterator) returns
    an iterator for a mapping on the source values.  Values are consumed
    on demand.
-   `filterIterator(callback(value, index, iterator))`: (Iterator) returns
    an iterator for those values from the source that pass the given
    guard.  Values are consumed on demand.


### Iterator utilities

-   `cycle(iterable, times)`
-   `concat(iterables)`
-   `transpose(iterables)`
-   `zip(...iterables)`: variadic transpose
-   `chain(...iterables)`: variadic concat
-   `range(start, stop, step)`: iterates from start to stop by step
-   `count(start, step)`: iterates from start by step, indefinitely
-   `repeat(value, times)`: repeats the given value either finite times
    or indefinitely


### Observables

`List`, `Set`, and `SortedSet` can be observed for content changes.

A content change handler can have various forms.  The simplest form is a
function that accepts `plus`, `minus`, and `index` as arguments where
`plus` is an array of added values, `minus` is an array of deleted
values, and `index` is the position of the change or undefined.  In that
case, `this` will be the collection that dispatches the event.

Alternately, you can dispatch events to a handler object.  If the
handler has a `handleContentChange` function (for noticing a change
after it has occurred) or a `handleContentWillChange` function (for
noticing a change before it has occurred), the event will be dispatched
to one of those.  The function has the same `(plus, minus, index)`
signature.

You can also dispatch change events to a DOM-compatible
`handleEvent(event)` method, in which case the handler will receive an
event with `phase`, `currentTarget`, `target`, `plus`, `minus`, and
`index` properties.  `phase` is either `"before"` or `"after"`.  The
targets are both the collection in flux.

-   `(plus, minus, index)`
-   `handleContentChange(plus, minus, index)`
-   `handleContentWillChange(plus, minus, index)`
-   `handleEvent({phase, currentTarget, target, plus, minus, index})`

The methods of the collection for managing content changes are generic,
in the `observable` module, and have the following forms:

-   `addContentChangeListener(listener, beforeChange)`
-   `removeContentChangeListener(listener, beforeChange)`
-   `dispatchContentChange(plus, minus, index)`
-   `addBeforeContentChangeListener(listener)`
-   `removeBeforeContentChangeListener(listener)`
-   `dispatchBeforeContentChange(plus, minus, index)`
-   `getContentChangeDescriptor()`


## List

Lists are backed by a cyclic doubly-linked list with a head node.  The
nodes are returned by "find" methods and accepted by "slice" and
"splice" as representatives of positions within the list.  Their
properties and methods are part of the interface of the structure.

-   `prev`: the previous node, or the `head` of the list if this is the
    first node
-   `next`: the next node, or the `head` of the list if this is the last
    node


## Set and Map

Set and map are like hash tables, but not implemented with a block of
memory as they would be in a lower-level language.  Most of the work of
providing fast insertion and lookup based on a hash is performed by the
underlying plain JavaScript object.  Each key of the object is a hash
string and each value is a List of values with that hash.  The inner
list resolves collisions.  With a good `hash` method, the use of the
list can be avoided.

Sets and maps both have a `log` function that displays the internal
structure of the bucket list in an NPM-style.

```
┣━┳ 1
┃ ┗━━ {"key":1,"value":"a"}
┣━┳ 2
┃ ┣━━ {"key":2,"value":"c"}
┃ ┗━━ {"key":2,"value":"d"}
┗━┳ 3
  ┗━━ {"key":3,"value":"b"}
```


## Sorted Set and Sorted Map

A binary splay tree is a balanced binary tree that rotates the most
frequently used items toward the root such that they can be accessed the
most quickly.  `sorted-set` and `sorted-map` are backed by a splay tree.

All map implementations use an underlying set implementation.  Any map
can be implemented trivially atop a set by wrapping `compare`, `equals`,
or `hash` to operate on the key of an item.

The sorted set has a `root` node.  Each node has a `left` and `right`
property, which may be null.  Nodes are returned by all of the "find"
functions, and provided as the `key` argument to callbacks.

Both `sorted-set` and `sorted-map` implement a `log` function which can
produce NPM-style visualizations of the internal state of the sorted
tree.

```
> set.log(SortedSet.ascii)
  .-+ -3
  | '-- -2
.-+ -1
+ 0
| .-- 1
'-+ 2
  '-- 3
```

```
> set.log(SortedSet.unicodeRound)
  ╭━┳ -3
  ┃ ╰━━ -2
╭━┻ -1
╋ 0
┃ ╭━┳ 1
┃ ┃ ╰━━ 2
╰━┻ 3
```

## Map and SortedMap

Maps share most of their implementation through `abstract-map`,
delegating to an `itemSet` property and overriding their operators to
follow the `key` property of each item in the set.  The set does most of
the work.


## Object Shim

The collection methods on the `Object` constructor all polymorphically
defer to the corresponding method of any object that implements the
method of the same name.  So, `Object.has` can be used to check whether
a key exists on an object, or in any collection that implements `has`.
This permits the `Object` interface to be agnostic of the input type.

The `object` module additionally provides an `Object.empty` frozen
object that can be reused as a default empty object to reduce
unnecessary allocations.

`Object.isObject(value)` tests whether it is safe to attempt to access
properties of a given value.

`Object.is(a, b)` compares objects for exact identity and is a good
alternative to `Object.equals` in many collections.

`Object.getValueOf(value)` safely and idempotently returns the value of
an object or value by only calling the `valueOf()` if the value
implements that method.

`Object.owns` is a shorthand for `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.


## Coupling

These collections strive to maximize overlapping implementations where
possible, but also be as loosely coupled as possible so developers only
pay for the features they need in the cost of download or execution
time.

For example, the default operators are simple, but much more powerful
operators can be shimmed, enhancing all of the collections.

Also, collections supply a `clone` method, but it can only do shallow
clones unless you shim `Object.clone` with the `object` module.
`Object.clone` works fine by itself, but can only resolve reference
cycles if you provide a map (WeakMap or Map) as its `memo` argument.

Another example, every collection provides an `iterate` implementation,
but each is only obligated to return an iterator that implements `next`.
For a much richer iterator, you can buy the `iterator` module and use
`Iterate(collection)` to get a much richer interface.
