# Collections

This package contains JavaScript implementations of common data
structures with idiomatic iterfaces, including extensions for Array and
Object.

You can use these Node Packaged Modules with Node.js, [Browserify][],
[Mr][], or any compatible CommonJS module loader.  Using a module loader
or bundler when using Collections in web browsers has the advantage of
only incorporating the modules you need.  However, you can just embed
`<script src="collections/collections.min.js">` and *all* of the
collections will be introduced as globals.  :warning:
`require("collections")` is not supported.

```
npm install collections --save
```
